# Coquette Note App

A simple note taking web application with a soft pink theme. Notes are stored in your browser's local storage so you can come back to them later.

## Getting Started

Open `index.html` in your browser. You can add a note using the textarea and "Add Note" button. Each note can be removed individually.

The styling is in `style.css` and the interactivity is handled by `script.js`.
